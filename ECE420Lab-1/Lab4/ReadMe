Read me for ECE 420 Lab4 Script Kit
Mar. 2017

=====
Overview:
    There are three groups of scripts in this kit
    
-----
    Data selection program and original data:
    web-Standford.txt	original data
    datatrim.c          source file to fetch a subset of the original data and pre-process it

-----
    Important functions:
    timer.h        macro definition for the time measurement
    Lab4IO.h       header for the Lab4IO.c, needs to be included if call the IOs directly from Lab4IO.c
    Lab4IO.c       source file for the IO functions, needs to be referred in the compiler line if the functions are called in the program

-----
    Verification program:
    serialtester.c source file for the testing program, depending on the Lab4IO.c
=====
Please also find the detailed instructions in the comments of the individual files.
Web Graph data is from http://snap.stanford.edu/data/web-Stanford.html


To build the application successfully first use datatrim.c to generate
the desired data_input_link and data_input_meta files required by the program
to run.

Secondly, on each cluster machine, setup the directories required so that the
./main executable has the same filepath relative-to-home on each cluster machine.
If running on our cluster machine "user_17", this has been taken care of already.
---THIS MAY REQUIRE EDITTING THE PATH VARIABLE IN THE MAKEFILE!!!---
You do not need to place the main executable in at this time as it will be
sent to the cluster when the executable is compiled.

Third, edit the makefile so that the directed IP addresses for each cluster
machine are correct. If running the program on our cluster machine "user_17", then
leave the makefile as it is. The directories have already been setup.

Fourth, run "make" to build the executable file, as well as to distribute the executable
and the input data files to the cluster machines as defined in the makefile/hosts.

Fifth, run "make run" or "mpirun -np 4 -f hosts ./main" to execute the program
in parallel with the other machines on the cluster. The output file will be
saved onto the master machine from which the program was initially run from.
